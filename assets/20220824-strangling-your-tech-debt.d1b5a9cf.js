<p>When we have a sensible service (big or small) starts failing on you.</p>
<p>The stench from the code base arose from the foul spaghetti monster, who happened to manifest itself from the long neglected care and inconsistent upkeeping;</p>
<p>Aren't something that we are willing to witness</p>
<p>But the eventuality that it surfaces is inevitable, and we have to do something about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's no longer will it happen, but <em>when</em> will happen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's not play the blame game, 'cause sometimes it might be <strong>US</strong> that's the faulter (yes at some point we're all guilty of it)</p>
<p>As we all hiking on this steep climb of attaining artisanship, away from lowly mediocrity in our crafts, we need tools and solutions.</p>
<p>It's in my interest in sharing and getting ideas and feedbacks from fellow SWE so that I may <em>git gud</em>. Hence with this as my first post in an attempt to document my findings, sharing stories and improve my writing haha</p>
<h3>I'm imploring the readers to take this journey with me, as I journal the trade-offs, ideas and overall skill-improving practices that we all can take a bigger stride and leap forward as artisans in our crafts</h3>
<p>I'll be writing occasionally, hopefully in a smaller bite-size content, I really didn't want to bore everyone \u{1F913}</p>
<p><em>Thoughts on upcoming topics to journal:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing tests on low coverage code base (In the case of Small Medium Business Projects)</li>
<li>DDD rewrites and transformation (What's DDD and how to convince your non-technical IT manager to trust you!)</li>
</ul>
