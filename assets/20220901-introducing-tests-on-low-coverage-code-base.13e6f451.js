<blockquote>
<h3><em>In my humble opinion, if you do not introduce test in your code base, and not maintaining the test, you're like eating pizza without dough</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic bread and butter in your everyday meal is gone, at the very moment you do not realize or ditched the use of tests in your code base. &quot;Lacking of nutrients&quot; is how I would put it.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Simple, you won't have the energy or confidence to enable you in your journey to &quot;scale&quot;, &quot;transform&quot;, &quot;revolutionize&quot; or &quot;disrupt the industry&quot; \u{1F64A}</p>
<p>Let's take for instance, if you have a team of 5-6 developers, how do you ensure whatever deployed is working as is? If that's not enough to convince you, perhaps I could point you to a direction where you should search &quot;why do i write test&quot;</p>
