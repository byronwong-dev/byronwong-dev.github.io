### I'm imploring the readers to take this journey with me, as I journal the trade-offs, ideas and overall skill-improving practices that we all can take a bigger stride and leap forward as artisans in our crafts

I'd be writing occasionally, hopefully in a smaller bite-size content, I really didn't want to bore everyone ðŸ¤“


_Thoughts on upcoming topics to journal:_
 - Introducing tests on low coverage code base (In the case of Small Medium Business Projects)
